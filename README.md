# Hi there 👋
I communicated with customers through various office programs before I transferred, and I transferred with the idea that consumers want to provide a convenient life.
I believe that FE developers have the advantage of communicating and interacting with the customer base the closest since transferring to the company.
I think the advantage is that it is easy to understand the customer's mind right after designing various screens.
For continuous development, I am studying through various school activities such as contest, club, data science, SQL, etc...!  
The study is currently learning about FE developers with secret code.
