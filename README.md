# Hi there 👋
I'm a front-end developer who focuses on user-centered development. I have gained extensive experience in transitioning from B2B to B2C, which has taught me how to accurately understand and meet user needs and expectations. I have been concentrating on developing various features using artificial intelligence and service industry data, with a priority on user experience.

I contribute to team projects through collaborative communication and agile problem-solving skills, and I aim to improve project quality through efficient code development and continuous feedback. My ultimate goal is to bring the services that users desire into reality, and I strive to continue growing to achieve that goal.
